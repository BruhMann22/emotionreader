# Emotion Reader

My emotion reader is a camera that can be pointed or used by anyone to read emotions. My emotion reader could help people who can't read facial expressions and understand social situations and feelings more.

## The Algorithm

First I had to create the camera, and identify it in my code [Imgur](https://imgur.com/vr2SYBz). Then I had to define my task and create my datasets [Imgur](https://imgur.com/kFnY0Vx). After that I needed to define which neural network I was using (ResNet18), and create widgets to display my image training popup. After that I took 24 images each of me being happy, sad, and neutral. Finally I had to code a release of the camera so that the emotion reader could be shut down [Imgur](https://imgur.com/7Kxhd7P).
